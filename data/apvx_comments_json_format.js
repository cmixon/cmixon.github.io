ARID2 mutations are found 4% of peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PMID: 25257991).",	
"ASXL1":	"In a patient with AML, mutation in ASXL1 is highly specific for secondary AML. In therapy related-AML and elderly de novo AML populations, ASXL1 alterations are associated with worse clinical outcomes, including a lower complete remission rate, more frequent reinduction, and decreased event-free survival. Somatic mutation in ASXL1 can be found in patients over the age of 50 without known hematologic malignancy, a condition known as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Most of these individuals lack cytopenias and have only a single mutation with low allele frequency. ASXL1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in CMML. ASXL1, located on 20q11, encodes for a member of the polycomb family of chromatin-binding proteins, which are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. ASXL1 mutations are commonly found in a variety of myeloid neoplasms, but they appear to be uncommon in lymphoid neoplasms. Somatic mutations in leukemia-associated genes, particularly ASXL1, DNMT3A, or TET2, can also be found in about 10% of elderly individuals without known hematologic malignancy, a condition known as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Most of these individuals, however, lack cytopenias and have only a single mutation with low allele frequency. The presence of a somatic mutation is associated with increases in the risk of developing a hematologic malignancy and in all-cause mortality, with the risk of developing a hematologic malignancy increased by a factor of nearly 50 in individuals with allele frequency of 10% or more (PMID: 25426837).  ASXL1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in MDS. ASXL1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in MPN. ASXL1 mutations can be seen in various myeloid neoplasms, and are associated with a poor prognosis in MDS, AML, MPN and CMML. ASXL1, located on 20q11, encodes for a member of the polycomb family of chromatin-binding proteins, which are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. ASXL1 mutations are found in 37% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (PMID: 27385790), 32% of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (PMID: 24072100), 29% of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis (PMID: 26874914), 23% of myelodysplastic syndrome (PMID: 24220272), 22% of primary myelofibrosis (PMID: 23619563), 17% of systemic mastocytosis (PMID: 27214377), 12% of polycythemia vera, 11% of essential thrombocythemia (Tefferi A, et al. Blood Advances 2016;1:21-30), and 11% of acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 27288520). ASXL1 mutations are associated with an unfavorable prognosis in myelodysplastic syndrome, independent of IPSS, IPSS-R, age, and other gene mutations. When mutation status is integrated into the survival analysis by IPSS risk categories, ASXL1 mutations are reported to shift the survival curve of the IPSS risk category to resemble that of the next highest IPSS risk level (PMID: 21714648). Accordingly, current guidelines state that gene mutation analysis can refine the prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome in patients risk stratified by the IPSS or IPSS-R, and may be helpful in patients predicted to have intermediate risk. ASXL1 mutations are independently associated with unfavorable outcomes and shorter survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome (PMID: 27601546). ASXL1 mutations are also associated with an unfavorable prognosis in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (only nonsense and frameshift mutations) (PMID: 27385790), refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis (PMID: 26874914), primary myelofibrosis (PMID: 23619563), polycythemia vera (Tefferi A, et al.

Somatic mutations in leukemia-associated genes, particularly ASXL1, DNMT3A, or TET2, can also be found in about 10% of elderly individuals without known hematologic malignancy, a condition known as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Most of these individuals, however, lack cytopenias and have only a single mutation with low allele frequency.

Blood Advances 2016;1:21-30), and 1% chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (PMID: 23690417). TP53 mutations are associated with an unfavorable prognosis in myelodysplastic syndrome, independent of IPSS, IPSS-R, age, and other gene mutations. When mutation status is integrated into the survival analysis by IPSS risk categories, TP53 mutations are reported to shift the survival curve of the IPSS risk category to resemble that of the next highest IPSS risk level (PMID: 21714648). Accordingly, current guidelines state that gene mutation analysis can refine the prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome in patients risk stratified by the IPSS or IPSS-R, and may be helpful in patients predicted to have intermediate risk. TP53 mutations are independently associated with unfavorable outcomes and shorter survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 27601546), but an increased response to decitabine in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 27959731). In low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated del(5q), TP53 mutations are associated with an unfavorable prognosis and decreased response to lenalidomide (PMID: 21519010). In myelodysplastic syndrome with complex karyotype, it appears that the adverse prognostic significance traditionally associated with complex karyotype may be dictated by the presence of TP53 mutation (PMID: 21714648). TP53 mutations are also associated with an unfavorable prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 27288520) and essential thrombocythemia (Tefferi A, et al. Blood Advances 2016;1:21-30).
