The criteria allow the presence of one additional chromosomal abnormality other than monosomy 7 or 7q deletion. ",

    "tr69":"In the current WHO classification, the t(6;9) translocation is presumptive evidence for myelodysplasia in the setting of persistent cytopenia of undetermined origin but without morphologic evidence of myelodysplasia and is also a recurrent anomaly in AML.  In the setting of AML, is does not qualify, however, as sufficient for diagnosis of AML with myelodysplasia-related changes.  It is seen in approximately 0.5% of cytogenetically abnormal cases of AML and has an association with FLT3  ITD mutations.   The leukemic blasts typically mark as myeloid but with CD9 positivity; trilineage dysplasia, Auer rods, and marrow basophilia are common morphologic observations.  The translocation is an unfavorable prognostic sign in the setting of AML. ",

A subset of patients will show internal tandem duplication of the KMT2A locus (at 11q23).  In the LeukemiaNet Standardized Reporting System for genetic abnormalities in AML, this karyotype is in the intermediate-II prognostic group, unless there is mutation of KMT2A, in which case it is in the adverse prognostic group. There is also an association with FLT3-ITD mutation as well. Although this anomaly is in the intermediate prognosis group in the IPSS-R MDS Cytogenetics Scoring system, published literature suggests that it is a marker for aggressive disease with rapid progression or leukemic transformation.

Usually there is monocytic and granulocytic differentiation, often with abnormal eosinophilic precursors. Secondary cytogenetic abnormalities occur in about 40% of cases; those with trisomy 22 as a secondary abnormality have been reported to have improved outcome. KIT mutations occur in approximately 30% of cases and are associated with less favorable prognosis and a higher risk of relapse. FLT3 mutations and trisomy 8 are also associated with worse outcome.

This fusion is a favorable prognostic sign, although 30% of cases will show relapse.  A significant proportion of patients will show secondary changes in the karyotype, most of which do not seem to affect prognosis. Most AML cases with this rearrangement fall into the FAB M2 subtype, and Auer rods are usually easily identified in the leukemic blasts.  Many cases show aberrant marking for CD19 and CD56 " ,
