<strong>ace</strong>:                     Acentric fragments (<strong>ace</strong>) other than dmin, even if present in more than one cell, should not be 
presented in the karyotype, but must be recorded in chromosome breakage studies.<br><br>
<strong>add</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>add</strong> (Latin, <i>additio</i>)
should be used to indicate additional material of unknown origin attached to a chromosome region or band.<br><br> 
<strong>amp</strong>: Number of FISH signals cannot be enumerated or meets the clinical definition of amplification for the gene under consideration.</p>
<strong>angled brackets (< >)</strong>:  The ploidy level with respect to which the karyotype is written, placed immediately after the chromosome count.</p>
<strong>c</strong>:                     A constitutional anomaly is indicated by the letter <strong>c</strong>

 after the abnormality designation. In the description of the karyotype,
 the constitutional anomaly is listed in chromosome number order. A clone with only a constitutional anomaly is, as the normal diploid clone, always listed last.</p>
<strong>con</strong>: Connected (fused) interphase FISH signals; normal for breakapart probes, abnormal for dual fusion probes.</p>
<strong>cp</strong>: composite karyotype contains all clonally 
occurring abnormalities and should also give the range of chromosome 
numbers in the metaphase cells containing the clonal abnormalities. The 
total number of cells in which the clonal changes were observed is given
in square brackets after the karyotype preceded by the symbol <strong>cp</strong>. The term <strong>cp</strong> should not be used to describe random loss.</p>
<strong>del</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>del</strong> is used to denote both <i>terminal</i> and <i>interstitial deletions</i>.  A deletion is a loss of a chromosome segment.<br><br>   
<strong>der</strong>:                     A <i>derivative chromosome</i> (<strong>der</strong>)
 is a structurally rearranged chromosome generated either by a rearrangement involving two or more chromosomes or by multiple aberrations within a single chromosome. The term always refers to the chromosome that has an intact centromere.<br>
                    &emsp; --A <strong>derivative chromosome generated by more than one rearrangement within a chromosome</strong> is specified in parentheses, followed by the type of abnormality. The detailed form is helpful in these cases.<br>
                    &emsp; --A <strong>derivative chromosome resulting from one rearrangement involving two or more chromosomes</strong> is specified in parentheses, followed by the type of abnormality.<br>
                    &emsp; --The term <i>Philadelphia chromosome</i> is for historical reasons retained to describe the derivative chromosome 22 generated by the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). The abbreviation <strong>Ph</strong> (formerly Ph<sup>1</sup>)may be used in text, but not in the description of the karyotype, where der(22)t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) is recommended. Similarly, the derivative chromosome 9 resulting from the t(9;22) is designated der(9)t(9;22)(q34;q11.2).<br>
                    &emsp; --A <strong>derivative chromosome generated by more than one rearrangement involving two or more chromosomes</strong>is specified in parentheses, followed by all aberrations involved in the generation of the derivative chromosome. The aberrations should be listed according to the breakpoints of the derivative chromosome from pter to qter and should not be separated by commas. When the centromere of the derivative chromosome is not known, but more distal parts of the chromosome can be recognized, the abnormal chromosome may be designated <strong>der(?)</strong>.<br>
&emsp; --In the description of karyotypes containing derivative chromosomes resulting from <i>unbalanced whole-arm translocations</i> the derivative chromosome (<strong>der</strong>) replaces the two normal chromosomes involved in the translocation. The two missing normal chromosomes are not specified. The imbalance(s) can be inferred from the karyotype.</p>
<strong>dic</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>dic</strong> is used to describe <i>dicentric chromosomes</i>.It is apparent from the symbol and from the specification of the chromosome(s) involved that the dicentric chromosome replaces two normal chromosomes. A dicentric chromosome is counted as one chromosome, with the normal chromosome count then becoming 45.<br><br>
<strong>dmin</strong>:                     <i>Double minutes</i>, abbreviated <strong>dmin</strong>, represent a special kind of acentric structures that should be recorded in the karyotype when present in more than one metaphase cell. Note that the dmin should not be included in the chromosome count, and that the symbol should not be preceded by a plus sign.<br><br>
<strong>dup</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>dup</strong> indicates a <i>duplication</i>.Duplications are a gain of a chromosome segment observed at the original chromosome location. When a gain of a chromosome segment is found elsewhere in the genome, <strong>der</strong> or <strong>ins</strong>should be used depending on the rearrangement. The orientation of the duplicated segment is indicated by the order of the bands <span>from pter to qter</span>.<br><br>
<strong>fis</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>fis</strong> is used to denote <i>centric fission</i>.<br><br>
<strong>fra</strong>:                     <i>Fragile sites</i>, abbreviated <strong>fra</strong>, may occur as normal variants or be associated with specific diseases and/or phenotypic abnormalities. In both situations the same nomenclature is used.<br><br>
<strong>hsr</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>hsr</strong> is used to describe the presence, but not the size, of <i>a homogeneously staining region</i> in a chromosome arm, segment, or band.<br><br>

<strong>i</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>i</strong> (not iso) is used for <i>isochromosomes</i> and <strong>idic</strong> for<i> isodicentric chromosomes</i>.The breakpoints in isochromosomes are assigned to the centromeric bands p10 and q10. The isochromosome designation is inferred from the banded 
chromosome morphology. Isochromosomes are usually formed through a centric mis-division and result in chromosome arms which are a mirror image.<br><br> 
<strong>idem</strong>:  In tumors with subclones the term <strong>idem</strong>
can be used, followed by the additional changes in relation to the 
stemline, which is listed first. Note that idem always refers to the 
karyotype listed first. This means that in tumors with multiple 
subclones each clonal change in addition to the first karyotype will 
have to be repeated. It also means that all plus and minus signs only 
refer to changes in relation to the stemline karyotype. As an 
alternative, for more than one sideline, sl and sdl could be used. Note 
that when two or more stemlines are present, there may also exist two or
 more sdl1, sdl2 and so on, which will reduce clarity. <strong>In such instances idem is preferred.</strong>
The term <strong>idem times a number</strong>
 (×2, ×3, etc.) may be used to designate aberrant polyploid clones.</p> 
<strong>ider</strong>:                     An <i>isoderivative chromosome</i>, abbreviated <strong>ider</strong>, designates an isochromosome formation for one of the arms of a derivative chromosome. The breakpoints are assigned to the centromeric bands p10 and q10 according to the morphology of the isoderivative chromosome.<br><br>
<strong>idic</strong>: <i>Isodicentric chromosomes</i> are designated <strong>idic</strong>. An isodicentric arises where there is a single breakpoint on sister chromatids and a subsequent reunion; the normal chromosome count is therefore 46. The term <strong>der</strong> may be used instead of <strong>dic</strong>, but the combination of <strong>der dic</strong> should never be used. Complex dicentric chromosomes must be described as derivative chromosomes.<br><br>
<strong>ins</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>ins</strong> is used for <i>insertions</i>. The orientation of the inserted segment is indicated by the order of the bands of the inserted segment from pter to qter. Unknown material <i>inserted</i> in a chromosome arm should be described by the use of the symbols <strong>ins</strong> ins and <strong>?</strong>.<br><br>
<strong>inv</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>inv</strong> is used. Whether it is a <i>paracentric</i> or <i>pericentric inversion</i> is apparent from the band designations. <span>In all cases, the breakpoint closer to pter of the inverted chromosome is specified first</span>.<br><br>
<strong>ish</strong>: Describes results of <strong>metaphase</strong> FISH.</p>
<strong>mar</strong>:                     A <i>marker chromosome</i> (<strong>mar</strong>) is a structurally abnormal chromosome that cannot be unambiguously 
identified or characterized by conventional banding cytogenetics. Numerous terms have been used in the literature to describe markers, including “supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMC),” “extra structurally and “accessory chromosomes (AC)”. Whenever any part of an abnormal can be recognized, it is a derivative chromosome (<strong>der</strong>) and can be adequately described by the nomenclature for derivative chromosomes. As soon as any part of an abnormal chromosome can be recognized, even if the origin of the centromere is unknown, this abnormal chromosome is referred to as a <strong>der</strong> and not as a <strong>mar</strong>.<br><br>
<strong>neo</strong>:  A neocentromere is a functional centromere that has arisen or been activated within a region not known to have a centromere. A chromosome with a neocentromere may be described with the <strong>neo</strong> symbol  or as a derivative chromosome with the assumption that a new centromere has arisen (or has been activated) within the region(s) from which the chromosome segment was derived.<br><br>
<strong>nuc ish</strong>: Describes results of <strong>interphase</strong> FISH.</p>
<strong>psu dic</strong>:  <i>pseudodicentric chromosome</i> is a dicentric structure in which only one centromere is active. Such chromosomes are abbreviated <strong>psu dic</strong> (similarly, <i>pseudotricentric</i>, <strong>psu trc</strong>, etc.), and the segment with the presumptively active centromere, based on the morphology in the majority of cells, is always written first. If the active centromere cannot be determined, the smallest chromosome number is written first.<br><br>
<strong>qdp</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>qdp</strong> is used. It is not possible to indicate the orientation(s) of the segment with the short form.<br><br>
<strong>question mark (?)</strong>: questionable identification of a chromosome or chromosome structure.  It is placed either <strong>before the uncertain item</strong>, or it may replace a chromosome, region, or band designation.</p>
<strong>r</strong>:                     A <i>ring</i>, designated by the symbol <strong>r</strong>, may be composed of one or several chromosomes. As in other rearrangements affecting a single chromosome, there is no semicolon between the band designations.  Ring chromosomes derived from more than one chromosome may contain one or several centromeres.<i>Monocentric ring chromosomes</i> are treated as derivative (<strong>der</strong>) chromosomes. The chromosome that provides the centromere is listed first. The orientation of the acentric segment is apparent from the order of the breakpoints. <i>Dicentric</i> or <i>tricentric ring chromosomes</i> are designated by the symbol <strong>r</strong> preceded by the abbreviation <strong>dic</strong> or <strong>trc</strong>.<br><br>
<strong>rec</strong>:                     A <i>recombinant chromosome</i> (<strong>rec</strong>) is a structurally rearranged chromosome with a new segmental composition resulting from <i>meiotic</i> crossing-over; consequently, this term should not be used in the description of acquired chromosome abnormalities, nor those resulting from malsegregation.<br><br>
<strong>rob</strong>:  either <strong>rob</strong> or <strong>der</strong> can adequately describe Robertsonian translocations, <strong>der</strong> is the preferred designation. The abbreviation rob should never be used in the description of acquired abnormalities.<br><br>
 If it is proven that the derivative chromosome resulting from a whole-arm translocation is <i>dicentric</i>, i.e., the breakpoints have been assigned to p11.2 or q11.2, the abbreviation <strong>dic</strong> should be used and the dicentric chromosome should be described accordingly.<br><br>
<strong>sep</strong>: Separated interphase FISH signals.</p>
<strong>sl</strong>: <i>stemline</i> (<strong>sl</strong>) is the most basic clone of a tumor cell population and is listed first. All additional deviating subclones are termed <i>sidelines</i> (<strong>sdl</strong>). To describe the stemlines or sidelines, these symbols, or the term <strong>idem</strong> (Latin = same), can be used. If more than one sideline is present, these may be referred to as sdl1, sdl2, and so on.  The term <strong>sl</strong> or <strong>sdl times a number</strong> (×2, ×3, etc.) may be used to designate aberrant polyploid clones.</p>
<strong>slant line (/):</strong>The karyotype designations of different clones and subclones are separated by a <strong>slant line</strong> (/).</p> 
<strong>square brackets ([ ]): </strong>The number of cells that constitute a clone is given in <strong>square brackets</strong>
 [ ] after the karyotype. When all cells are normal, the number of cells
 is still specified. Cytogenetically related clones are written in order
 of increasing complexity, irrespective of the size of the clone.</p>
<strong>t</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>t</strong> is used to denote a <i>translocation</i>,which refers to the exchange of terminal segments of chromosomes. When a translocation is balanced, there is no discernable gain or loss of chromosomal material. In the description of karyotypes containing derivative chromosomes resulting from <i>unbalanced whole-arm translocations</i> the derivative chromosome (<strong>der</strong>) replaces the two normal chromosomes involved in the translocation. The two missing normal chromosomes are not specified. The imbalance(s) can be inferred from the karyotype designation.<br><br>
<strong>tas</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>tas</strong> is used to describe a <i>telomeric association</i>, which is typically a single cell abnormality and therefore not reported as a clonal abnormality. In telomeric associations between two chromosomes, the sex chromosome or the autosome with the lowest number is specified first.<br><br> 
<strong>tilde (~)</strong>:  used to denote intervals and to express uncertainty about breakpoint localizations in that it indicates the boundaries of a chromosome segment in which the breaks may have occurred.</p>
<strong>trc</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>trc</strong> is used for tricentric chromosomes. The “end” chromosome which has the lowest number, or is one of the sex chromosomes, is specified first. The other chromosomes are listed in the order they are attached to the chromosome listed first. The orientation of the chromosomes will be apparent from the order of the breakpoints.<br><br> 
<strong>trp</strong>:                     The symbol <strong>trp</strong> is used for triplications. It is not possible to indicate the orientation(s) of the segment in the short form, but this can be done with the detailed form.<br><br>
<strong>x</strong>:                       The <strong>multiplication sign</strong> (×) can be used to describe two or more copies of a structurally rearranged chromosome. The number of copies (×2, ×3, etc.) should be placed after the abnormality. The multiplication sign should not be used to denote multiple copies of normal chromosomes.<br><br>
